-- THE WISE DOGGO PROJECT --

Use git and GitHub to version-control this project.
Name the project ⁠ wise-doggo ⁠ on your GitHub account, then clone it locally and start making commits and pushing your changes as you work on the project.

WEBPAGE STRUCTURE:

[ image of dog ]

[ wise quote ]

[ ⁠ ENLIGHTEN ME ⁠ -> button to be pressed ]

CONCEPT:
The idea is very simple. Anytime the button is pressed, the dog image and wisdom quote get replaced with new versions.
In order to fetch these, use the following API endpoints:
Random Dog Images: https://place.dog/400/400
Random Quotes: https://api.quotable.io/random

These endpoints generate a new image / quote with each new GET HTTP request.
You should put together a simple webpage, and write JS for it so that the button "listens" to every time it is clicked and it replaces the image and the quote with newly fetched images and quotes from the endpoints mentioned above.

Have fun with it!
